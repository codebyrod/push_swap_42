# Description
*Push_swap* is an algorithmic project from the 42 curriculum focused on sorting  data using a restricted set of operations.  
The goal of the project is to sort a stack of integers in ascending order using 
the smallest possible number of operations, while respecting a predefined instruction set.

The program receives a list of integers as arguments, stores them in a stack (`stack A`), and outputs a sequence of operations that will sort the stack using an auxiliary stack (`stack B`).  
Only specific operations such as swap, push, rotate, and reverse rotate are 
allowed.

Operations allowed:
-sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.
-sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.
--ss : sa and sb at the same time.

-pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
-pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.

-ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.
-rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.
--rr : ra and rb at the same time.

-rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.
-rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.
--rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.

Example:
"./push_swap 3 2 1"
Expected:
*sa*
*rra*

Two moves to organize.

For maximum project validation (100%) must:
-   Sort 100 random numbers in fewer than 700 operations.
    Sort 500 random numbers in no more than 5500 operations.

For minimal project validation (which implies a minimum grade of 80%):
-100 numbers in under 1100 operations and 500 numbers in under 8500 operations ✓
-100 numbers in under 700 operations and 500 numbers in under 11500 operations
-100 numbers in under 1300 operations and 500 numbers in under 5500 operations

## Instructions
make *- To compile*
make clean *- To erase all object files*
make fclean *- Erase all generated files*
make re *- the same execution of "make fclean" followed by "make"*

Open the terminal on your push_swap's root folder and type "make", it will 
generate all object files and the executable "push_swap".

### Checker-linux
To test with the checker, you need to download the checker from the 42School's 
Page (link on resources) and put into the project's root folder. Now you have to
update the permissions for the checker:
"chmod 777 checker_linux"

Then you can test something like this:

"./push_swap 3 2 1 | ./checker_linux 3 2 1"
Expected: *Ok*
Error Result: *Ko*

#### Visualize
When you run:
./push_swap <number1 number2 ...> 
or 
./push_swap <"number1 number2 ...">

The return you have will be the moviments/operations needed to sort the list of 
numbers.

To test and visualize, you can make like the example above on *Instructions* and
insert the numbers manually or, my suggestion, use the online tester shown on 
*Resources*, you can generate *n* numbers you want and copy. Then you just click
on *copy* and paste it in your terminal. 

You have to erase the end "| pbcopy" OR you can change this last part for 
"| wl-copy" but you need to install it first (it is on Resources). This copies 
all the instructions generated. Otherwise, you will have to copy by yourself.

Then, you return to your online tester go on *instructions* and paste the 
instructions.

Then, you go to *simulation*, choose your time and *play*. You will visualize 
the sorting process.

Easier to copy  -   sudo apt install wl-clipboard
                    wl-copy

Ai was used during the development proccess to help with some concepts, review 
explanations and perform small tests.
